      <h3>Who We Are</h3>
      <p>Pete's Marine Service has been keeping boats on the water since 2008. I’m Pete, and I specialize in outboard motor repair, rebuilds, and custom marine electrical work. I’m detail-oriented and I take pride in doing the job right the first time.</p>

      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <p>I’ve worked in the marine industry for over 15 years. Whether it’s routine service, troubleshooting tough problems, or installing the latest electronics, my goal is to make sure you spend more time on the water and less time at the dock.</p>

      <h3>Our Promise</h3>
      <p>Reliable, honest service — done with care. I stand by my work and treat every boat like it’s my own.</p>
